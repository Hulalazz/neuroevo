This is working code from me to me. I am not producing community-quality
code ATM, just squeezing back what I need from my old Mathematica code.

The gem build is there for easier import rather than sharing purposes.
I presently consider the future of this code as a future consideration.

That said, if you'd like to make my code your own, you'll find me most
enthusiast :)
